# imca-raydeeoh
IMCA RAYDEEOH is an internet hosted radio by Intermedia students, available for active participation from all students of the Fine Arts Faculty, and accessible for listening to anyone within reach of an internet connection. The purpose of this web-radio would be to showcase the work of students in Fine Arts who are interested in sharing their own sound pieces, mixes, podcasts, and any other audio content relating to DIY, experimental or non-mainstream arts. 

NB: This website was originally created by myself and Matthew Halpenny in 2019. We we're both still new to coding at the time (my code was absolute spaghetti) so I've decided to redo the front-end from the original mock-ups for the sake of archiving. It's fun to see how much we've learned in the last couple of years, which is why this repository is still public. You can find the updated website here: ***
